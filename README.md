## Technologies Used
- [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) - Angular 2 is an open source JavaScript framework to build web applications in HTML and JavaScript.
- [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. One of the big benefits is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment for spotting common errors as you type the code.
- [Node.js - NPM](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_npm.asp) - NPM is the package manager for JavaScript and the world’s largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.
- [Bower](https://bower.io/) - Bower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files.
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow.
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is an extension of CSS. Sass allows you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organized and allows you to create stylesheets faster.
